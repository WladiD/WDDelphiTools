### Notepad++ Syntax Highlighting
*   **File:** `userDefineLang_DptAiWorkflow.xml`
*   **Description:** A User Defined Language (UDL) definition that provides syntax highlighting for `.DptAiWorkflow` files. It highlights guards, logical operators, and built-in DPT functions.

**Installation:**
1.  Copy the XML file to your Notepad++ user definition directory:
    *   `%AppData%\Notepad++\userDefineLangs`
2.  Restart Notepad++.
3.  The highlighting will be automatically applied to `.DptAiWorkflow` files. You can also select it manually from the **Language** menu (usually listed at the bottom as *DptAiWorkflow*).
